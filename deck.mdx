import { Appear } from 'mdx-deck';

# Why doe?

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <li>Virtual DOM</li>
        <li>Reusable Web Components</li>
        <li>The Community</li>
        <li>Plays Nice With Others</li>
    </Appear>
</ul>

```

## JSX vs HTML & JS

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <span><JS /></span>
        <span><JSX /></span>
    </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- Writes like html but is NOT html
- A lot cleaner
- Allows us to use JavaScript expressions
```

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <span>
            <SimpleBtn 
                color="firebrickred"
                backgroundColor="papayawhip"
                text="Click meh" />
        </span>
        <span>
            <SimpleBtn 
                color="white"
                backgroundColor="dodgerblue"
                text="wassssssup" />
        </span>
        <span>
            <SimpleBtn 
                color="purple"
                backgroundColor="orange"
                text="i iz a btn yo" />
        </span>
        <span>
            <SimpleBtn 
                color="white"
                backgroundColor="limegreen"
                text="still a btn" />
        </span>
        <span>
            <SimpleBtn 
                color="gold"
                backgroundColor="lightslategray"
                text="yup...btn" />
        </span>
    </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- Could even include a function to create as many SimpleBtns as needed
```

# Props vs. State

```notes
- Props are like function params, passing to comps
- State is managed within the comp that is declaring it, think of a local variable
```

---

import Counter from './src/Counter';

## State

![](src/images/state.png)

<Counter />

```notes
- If it has state, it's a class...for now
- Constructor? Binding?
- You don't "update" state, you "replace" it
- React catches state changes and update VDOM
- PrevState
- Notice the brackets in JSX
```
